# Differential Privacy LSTM for Stock Prediction with Financial News
The project involved detailed sentiment analysis of financial news articles and sophisticated time series analysis of stock prices. It determined that LSTM models, reinforced with differential privacy (LSTM-DP), surpassed conventional time series models in forecasting accuracy with a 60% reduction in MSE due to their more robust feature integration.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following components:
